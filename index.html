            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>The question of what makes something literary is an enduring one, and I dont expect that well answer it fully in this short video. Instead, I want to show you a few different ways that literary critics approach this question and then offer a short summary of the 3 big factors that we must consider when we ask the question ourselves.
                Lets begin by making a distinction between “Literature with a capital L” and “literature with a small. Literature with a small l” designates any written text: we can talk about “the literature” on any given subject without much difficulty.
                Literature with a capital L”, by contrast, designates a much smaller set of texts  a subset of all the texts that have been written.</p>
